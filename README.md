## Description:
This is a MERN application utilising the Google Books API to allow users to search for books by title and save favourites to their account. Passport and Google OAuth 2.0 has been used to allow authentication and user specific accounts and personalised book lists. The backend has been created using an Express server and the front end is rendered using React.js.

## Installation:
Clone folder onto your own computer by forking the repository and using the "Clone or download" button on github. Install all npm modules using the command "npm install". Open up your MongoDB connection. Run the server by calling "npm start" from the root folder.

## Usage:
The deployed application can be accessed at https://phillidp-book-search.herokuapp.com/login.\n\nThe user will need to login with Google, Facebook or Github to access the search functionality. Once logged in, the user is redirected to the search page where they can search for a book title. Search results display the book image, title, authors, description and a link to the Google Books site. There is also a heart icon enabling the user to save the specific book to their dashboard. The dashboard can be accessed through the navigation bar and this page shows all books saved by the logged in user. Books can be viewed and deleted.
